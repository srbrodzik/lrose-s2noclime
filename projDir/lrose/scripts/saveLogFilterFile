# This is a small script that will move a log file
# from the LogFilter utility to a timestamped file. If an app is
# crashing, the last few messages will be at the end of the timestamped file.
# This makes it easier to see where the app crashed in some cases.
#
# The intent is that this should be used as a debugging tool invoked
# in the start script for an app, so that when the app restarts its
# previous log file is moved. An example of using this in a start script :
#
# running "DrawFmq2Bdry -params DrawFmq2Bdry.niwot"
# if ($status == 1) then
#  saveLogFilterFile $LOG_DIR DrawFmq2Bdry niwot
#  echo "Starting DrawFmq2Bdry -params DrawFmq2Bdry.niwot"
#  DrawFmq2Bdry -params DrawFmq2Bdry.niwot |& \
#  LogFilter -d $LOG_DIR -p DrawFmq2Bdry -i niwot >& /dev/null &
# endif
