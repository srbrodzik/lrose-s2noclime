# Script to start an LDM in a way suitable for our
# purposes at RAL, or stop a running ldm. Input argument should be
# either "stop" or "start". Adopted from :
# 
# http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/ldm-6.5.1/basics/configuring.html#boot
#
# If the ldm is running with a good product queue,
# then running this with the "start" argument has no effect.
# Thus, it can be run quite frequently in cron, possibly
# like this :
#
# */5 * * * * csh -c "ldmMgr start  >& /dev/null"
