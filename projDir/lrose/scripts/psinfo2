#  from the ps(1) manpage
â€‹
#  rss  RSS  resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (inkiloBytes).  (alias rssize, rsz).
#  size SIZE approximate amount of swap space that would be required if the process were to dirty all writable pages and then be swapped out.  This number is very rough!
#  sz   SZ   size in physical pages of the core image of the process.  This includes text, data, and stack space.  Device mappings are currently excluded; this is subject to change.  See vsz and rss.
#  vsz  VSZ  virtual memory size of the process in KiB (1024-byte units).  Device mappings are currently excluded; this is subject to change.  (alias vsize).
